like-predicate.txt

In MovieListServlet.java I run a query based on the search parameters passed in by SearchServlet.java and its corresponding js and html file.
For the standard search parameters of movie title, movie director, movie year, and star name I use LIKE '%parameter%', with the parameter
being the passed in information from the search form. When doing browse by genre I match up the browse attribute and hyperlink it from the browseGenre.html.
Same logic applies to my browseTitle.html, with a new parameter called first_char that is passsed in and matched with LIKE 'char&' for the first character
to match up.
