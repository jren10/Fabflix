First method of checking for duplicates/inserting movies:

We ran a SQL query returning all movies with the same movie_id as the one we were looking to insert. If the query returned
an empty table, we would proceed with inserting the movie.

runtime: ~180 seconds (3 minutes)

Second method of checking for duplicates/inserting movies:

We copied the movie table to memory in the form of a map. After checking to see if the new movie id was in the map, we
would insert it into the table if it wasn't there and then update the map.

runtime: ~73 seconds (1.2 minutes)

Third method of checking for duplicates/inserting movies:

We copied the movie table into a map, checked against the map to see if the new movie was already stored, and then on a hit,
we wrote the new data to file.

At the end of checking all of the new movies, we inserted all of the info into the database with one SQL call, using
the data from the file.

runtime: ~.5 seconds (.008 minutes)
