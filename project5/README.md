I used python for my parsing script, named findAvg.py. This python file opens up a .txt file and then reads the input.
Each file has its search/jdbc times added up, then divided by the number of lines. We divide then by 1000000 to get to 
our unit in milliseconds. The outputs were then saved in our ~/project5/JMeter Testing/Logs and then either /8080 or /80
depending on the scaled or original instance. I used filezilla to move the files to my local machine, then placed into our 
project folder and pushed to github.
